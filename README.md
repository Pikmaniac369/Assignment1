## How I Did The Assignment
I started the assignment by first creating a set of practice files. I did this as I struggle with this module quite a bit and was not sure where to start. I created a practice file for almost everything I wanted to include. I have included the practice files in the folder CA_1_Practice.

After finishing with the practice files, I moved on to the main Sketch. I named the project CA_1 and it has six classes: Button, Defence_Matrix, Radar, Reticle, Gun and Star. Button holds the fields and methods for drawing and updating the buttons at the bottom of the UI. Defence_Matrix has the methods for drawing the Defence Matrix when its button is pressed. Radar holds the fields and methods for drawing and updating the Radar when its button is pressed. Reticle holds the fields and methods for drawing the reticle. Gun holds the fields and methods for drawing and attempting (without success) to fire the guns when their button is pressed. Star holds the fields and methods for drawing and updating the stars as well as creating the hyperspace effect when the Boosters button is pressed.

I made numerous attempts to make the guns work. I have included these failed attempts in the CA_1_Practice folder as Rocket_Practice and Bullet_Practice.
